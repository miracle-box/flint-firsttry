# Flint (The very first try)

# Original README

*(Since nobody uses this package, I deleted it.)*

Static document generator as an [Astro](https://astro.build/) integration. (Just like [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/))

This project is for my personal use and still under development.

_If you want to create an awesome documentation site, please use [**Starlight**](https://starlight.astro.build/)._
